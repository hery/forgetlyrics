ForgetLyrics
==========

Ever get tired of those lyrics websites full of ads? 
We all do, which is why I wrote this small script that fetches lyrics in your terminal.

# Installation

## Dependencies

+ python 2.7
+ requests (pip install requests)

## Api Key

The api key that is hard-coded in the script is mine, but feel free to sign up to musixmatch.com to get yours and replace it, as each API key has a limited number of calls.

# Usage

python forgetlyrics.py
